In this first lecture of our walkthrough the NEBOSH General Certificate we examine the broad nature of the occupational health and safety practitioners' role, before moving on to define some of the key subjects in the field - safety, health and welfare.

Multi-disciplinary Role
-----------------------
The role of the health and safety practitioner is broad, challenging and complex, it can feel a very thankless task at times, yet at other times incredibly rewarding.  As a result an effective health and safety practitioner is a very versatile creature with much variety in their role.  

Key tasks in the health and safety role might include:
- Writing policies and procedures
- Assessing risks
- Investigating accidents
- Advising managers and directors
- Consulting with employees
- Training 
- Managing Contractors
- Liasing with third parties including auditors, regulators and insurers

To be able to complete all these functions properly health and safety practitioners need a broad range of transferrable skills, they need to be able to:
- Communicate effectively
- Maintain their independence
- Work at all levels of the organisations they work within
- Organise their workload
- Prioritise
- Delegate
- Maintain their own competence.

It is very rare these days that the health and safety function in an organisation sit in isolation.  Other roles often combined with the Health and safety function include:
- Environmental Management
- Quality Management
- Security
- Training
- Food Safety
- Transport

leading to the creation of the HSEQ Manager, HSET Manager, QHSE Manager, SHEQ Manager, HSE & Compliance Manager and so on - all dependent upon the priorities of the organisations they work for.  The point being that every health and safety role is different, (and very often every day is differtent too!) and that health and safety professionals often need to adapt and upskill to accept other requirements in to their role.

It should also be noted that occupational health and safety covers a broad range of more specialist areas, which we will touch on in more detail later on.  While the general health and safety practitioner does not need to know everything about these specialisms, they do need an overview and broad understanding of what they are and their application.  Such specialisms include:

- occupational health
> which is primarily concerned with monitoring individuals for the onset of disease and ill-health arising from exposure to hazards

- occupational hygiene
> primarily concerned with examining and controlling individuals exposure to dangerous substances that can cause ill-health.

- ergonomics
> which is as field concerned with ensuring that the work process is designed to be aligned to the individual and thereby reducing the likelihood of human error.
