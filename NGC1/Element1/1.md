In this first lecture of our walkthrough the NEBOSH NGC1 'Management of Health and Safety' module we examine the broad nature of the occupational health and safety practitioners' role, before moving on to define some of the key subjects in the field - safety, health and welfare.

## Multi-disciplinary Role

The role of the health and safety practitioner is broad, challenging and complex, it can feel a very thankless task at times, yet at other times incredibly rewarding.  As a result an effective health and safety practitioner is a very versatile creature with much variety in their role.  

Key tasks in the health and safety role might include:
- Writing policies and procedures
- Assessing risks
- Investigating accidents
- Advising managers and directors
- Consulting with employees
- Training 
- Managing Contractors
- Liasing with third parties including auditors, regulators and insurers

To be able to complete all these functions properly health and safety practitioners need a broad range of transferrable skills, they need to be able to:
- Communicate effectively
- Maintain their independence
- Work at all levels of the organisations they work within
- Organise their workload
- Prioritise
- Delegate
- Maintain their own competence.

It is very rare these days that the health and safety function in an organisation sit in isolation.  Other roles often combined with the Health and safety function include:
- Environmental Management
- Quality Management
- Security
- Training
- Food Safety
- Transport

leading to the creation of the HSEQ Manager, HSET Manager, QHSE Manager, SHEQ Manager, HSE & Compliance Manager and so on - all dependent upon the priorities of the organisations they work for.  The point being that every health and safety role is different, (and very often every day is differtent too!) and that health and safety professionals often need to adapt and upskill to accept other requirements in to their role.

It should also be noted that occupational health and safety covers a broad range of more specialist areas, which we will touch on in more detail later on.  While the general health and safety practitioner does not need to know everything about these specialisms, they do need an overview and broad understanding of what they are and their application.  Such specialisms include:

- occupational health
> which is primarily concerned with monitoring individuals for the onset of disease and ill-health arising from exposure to hazards

- occupational hygiene
> primarily concerned with examining and controlling individuals exposure to dangerous substances that can cause ill-health.

- ergonomics
> which is a field concerned with ensuring that the work process is designed to be aligned to the individual and thereby reducing the likelihood of human error.

## Barriers to Good Standards of Health and Safety
### Complexity 
We have already seen that the health and safety profession is one that has broad boundaries, is challenging and has a range of specialist areas within it.  Health and safety professionals are usually generalists who need to know a broad subject area in great depth, but who also cannot be expected to know everything about a field as complex as ergonomics for instance.  This poses one of the great challenges for health and safety professionals - knowing the limits of our competence, and when to seek expert support.

Sometimes the measures that need to be implemented can be complex too, which can result in items lading in the _too difficult_ pile.  An organisation might identify the need to

## Key Definitions

We conclude this introduction to health and safety management by defining some of the underpinning terms in the health and safety profession - health, safety, and welfare.  When we move on to look at the requirements of health and safety law later on in this course we will see that employers are required to take measures to protect the health, safety _and_ welfare of their employees - what do these words mean, and how do they interact with and differ from one another?

### Health
When as health and safety professionals we talk about health we are usually talking about keeping employees are others free from ill-health or disease.  Usually we are concerned with exposure to chemical, biological and psychosocial factors that can make people unwell.  This is in contrast to safety which is usually concerned with exposure to physical hazards that cause physical injury.

One of the mistake health and safety professionals tend to make is not paying adequate attention to occupational health.  In part this is due to latency - often ill-health following exposure can cause many months or years to manifest, exposure to asbestos for instance can take 40 years or more to result in mesothelioma.  Health hazards can be more difficult to see and identify too.

### Safety
When talking about safety, occupational health and safety professionals are usually talking about keeping employees and others free from physical injury.  Unlike health hazards safety hazards are usually very immediate, often apparent, and are also often easier to explain the significance of to others such as managers, directors and employees.  It is often easier to convince an employer that they need to provide a guard to a pice of machinery, than it is to convince them that they need to better control exposure to substances such as wood dust for instance.

Notwithstanding asny of the above it should be noted that significantly more people are killed in the UK each year through historic exposure to dangerous substances than are killed in an accident at work.

### Welfare
When we talk about welfare, we are usually talking about the provision of facilities in the workplace for employees.  We might be referring to the provision of toilet and washing facilities, of first aid facilities, of places to eat and drink.  We might also be talking about maintaining the environment in the workplace at comfortable temperastures. 

While welfare is about provision of facilities and a comfortable working environment, it should be noted that welfare has the ability to impact on both safety and health.  Empoloyees that cannot wash their hands properly before eating, for instance, are more likely to ingest the dangerous substance that they work with and suffer ill health.  Employees who are too hot or cold, or with poor lighting are more likely to have accidents in the workplace, impacting on safety.

## Summary
In this first lesson of our walkthrough of the NEBOSH NGC1 'Management of Health and Safety' module we looked at the complexity of the modern health and safety professional's role, along with some of the other disciplines it tends to come with.  We also looked at some of the barriers to achieving good hesalth and safety mangement.  We conculded by looking at definitions of some of ther defining terms in the health and safety field - ghealth, safety and welfare.
